Data Import: All CSV files were imported into MySQL Workbench.
Tables Used:
1.	Customers
2.	Products
3.	Orders
4.	Order_details
5.	E-commerce Company

## SQL Analysis:
1.	JOIN operations for combining relational tables.
2.	GROUP BY and HAVING for aggregated insights.
3.	SUM, COUNT for total revenue, market segments.
4.	Used the LAG() function to calculate the month-on-month percentage change in total sales

## Business KPI Modeling:
Designed queries to track key metrics like:

2.	Unique Customers
3.	Total Sales
4.	Total Revenue

## 🔍 Key Insights
Here are some actionable insights derived from the SQL analysis:
1.	Market Segmentation – Identified the top 3 cities with the highest customer base.
